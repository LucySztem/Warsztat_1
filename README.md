Simple programs based on “guess the number” games. I’ve used basic JAVA to write those programs. 

1) GuessTheNumber2

This is a program where user selects number from 0 to 100 and computer will guess the chosen number within 10 tries by entering commands by User in the console “za duzo”(to much), “za malo”(less than that) and “zgadles”(you got it). If after 10 tries the computer will not get the number it will show a warning to the user to not cheat.

2) Lotto

As the name suggests, user will be guessing 6 numbers that computer have selected from 49 numbers.
Depending on how many of the numbers user has guessed appropriate statement will show in console.

3) Main 1

Computer will choose 1 number from 0-101 and user needs to guess it by entering the numbers in console. The program will indicate if the User is close or far away from the number by displaying statements in the console after each guess.
